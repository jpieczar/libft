# libft
Jono's basic C library.

You are free to see my code to help you build your own library.

Makefile commands:
~$make (compiles the library .a file and makes .o files)
~$make clean (deletes the .o files)
~$make fclean (deletes both the .a and . .o files)
~$make re (runs fclean and then make)

-(lstadd, lstdel, lstdelone, lstiter, lstmap and lstnew) Deal with a linked list.
-(putnode, newdnode, loopdloop and pooldpool) Deal with a doubly linked list.
Their respective structs are in the libft.h file.

Do not steal this and claim it as your own.
Stealing is a sin and you might go to hell.

Enjoy the rest of your day :D
